In the bubble we live; we are the sisters of Mermaids <!--more-->
Sea, Mama: Humans in you are like salt ——  
What makes you all-mighty also brings bitter.   
In pain, we swim inside your uterus; for unborn infants how suffering.   
But what captures pain are the fresh wounds.   

With the bubbling water we sit,   
checking out the bumping sound a street kid made  
Ah, human created that sound like the universe shooting out stars;  
––– Some fall, in a way to reborn.   

The grind for coffee beans makes a good coffee;   
The grind for humans makes a generation mature.   
Today, God is not invited because we didn’t prepare his meal.   
But in the embrace he sneaked in. Declaring its presence by healing.
